# Progress: Rafey Blog

## 1. What Works / Current Capabilities

Based on the initial project structure and recent fixes:

*   **Core Payload CMS Setup**: 
    *   Payload CMS is configured and integrated within the Next.js application.
    *   The admin panel (likely accessible via `/admin`) is functional for managing collections.
    *   Defined collections exist: `Categories`, `Media`, `Pages`, `Posts`, `Users`.
    *   Defined globals exist: `Header`, `Footer`.
    *   Several plugins are integrated: `form-builder`, `nested-docs`, `redirects`, `search`, `seo`, `live-preview-react`, `admin-bar`.
    *   Rich text editing with Lexical is available.
    *   Content blocks (`ArchiveBlock`, `CallToActionBlock`, `CodeBlock`, `ContentBlock`, `FormBlock`, `MediaBlock`) are defined and can be used within Payload.
*   **Next.js Frontend Foundation**: 
    *   The Next.js application is running and can serve pages.
    *   Basic routing is in place using the App Router.
    *   Tailwind CSS is set up for styling.
    *   A custom `not-found.tsx` page is implemented and correctly displays for non-existent routes, using client-side components.
*   **Development Environment**: 
    *   The project can be set up and run locally using `pnpm` or Docker.
    *   TypeScript is used across the project for type safety.
    *   Linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier) are configured.
*   **API Endpoints**: Payload automatically generates API endpoints for collections and globals, accessible via `/api/...`.
*   **Memory Bank**: Initial documentation for the project (this Memory Bank) has been created.

## 2. What's Left to Build (for Full Blog Functionality)

This list focuses on the conversion to a full-stack blog application:

### Frontend (Next.js):
*   **Homepage**: Design and implement a homepage that likely lists recent/featured blog posts.
*   **Blog Post Listing Page**: A dedicated page to display all blog posts, with pagination, filtering (by category/tag), and sorting options.
*   **Individual Blog Post Page**: A dynamic page to display the full content of a single blog post, including title, author, date, content (rendering Lexical output and blocks), comments (if planned).
*   **Category/Tag Archive Pages**: Pages that list all posts belonging to a specific category or tag.
*   **Author Pages (Optional)**: Pages listing all posts by a specific author.
*   **Search Results Page**: A page to display results from the search functionality (leveraging `@payloadcms/plugin-search` on the frontend).
*   **Navigation**: Implement dynamic navigation using data from `Header` and `Footer` globals, and potentially category listings.
*   **UI for Blocks**: Ensure all defined Payload blocks (`ArchiveBlock`, `CallToActionBlock`, etc.) render correctly and are styled on the frontend.
*   **Styling and Theming**: Comprehensive styling for all blog elements to create a cohesive and professional look.
*   **Responsive Design**: Ensure the blog is fully responsive across various devices.
*   **SEO Implementation**: Integrate metadata from `@payloadcms/plugin-seo` into page heads (titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.).
*   **Sitemap**: Ensure the sitemap generated by `@payloadcms/plugin-seo` is accessible.
*   **Contact Page/Form (Optional)**: If the `FormBlock` or `plugin-form-builder` is to be used for a contact form.

### Backend (Payload CMS - Primarily Configuration & Content Strategy):
*   **Refine Content Models**: Review and adjust fields in `Posts`, `Categories`, and other relevant collections to perfectly suit blog needs (e.g., adding fields for excerpts, read time, social sharing images).
*   **Content Seeding/Examples**: Populate with example blog posts and categories to aid frontend development.
*   **User Roles for Blog**: Define specific roles if needed (e.g., 'Blogger', 'Editor') beyond default Payload roles.

### Integrations & Other Features:
*   **Comments System (Optional)**: Decide on and integrate a commenting system (e.g., Disqus, self-hosted, or a custom solution).
*   **Newsletter Signup (Optional)**: Integrate with a newsletter service.
*   **Analytics (Optional)**: Integrate web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).
*   **Live Preview Refinement**: Ensure live preview works seamlessly for all blog content types and blocks.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase**: Initial Setup & Foundation Review.
*   **Progress**: The foundational Next.js + Payload CMS project is operational. The `not-found` page issue has been resolved. The Memory Bank is being established.
*   **Next Immediate Action**: Begin planning and implementing the core blog frontend pages (e.g., post listing and individual post views).

## 4. Known Issues / Challenges

*   **Project Scope**: The conversion to a "full-stack blog application" is broad. Specific features and the level of polish need to be clearly defined and prioritized.
*   **Learning Curve**: If unfamiliar with specific Payload plugins or advanced Next.js App Router features, there might be a learning curve.
*   **Data Fetching Patterns**: Establishing efficient and correct data fetching patterns between Next.js Server/Client Components and Payload APIs will be crucial.
*   **Styling Complexity**: Implementing a custom, polished design with Tailwind CSS can be time-consuming.
*   **Legacy Code/Configuration**: The project is a template. There might be example code or configurations (`my-route/`) that are not relevant to the blog and may need cleanup.
