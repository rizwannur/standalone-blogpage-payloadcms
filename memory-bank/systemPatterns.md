# System Patterns

This project follows a modern web application architecture, leveraging a headless CMS and a Next.js frontend.

## System Architecture:
- **Headless CMS (Payload CMS):** Manages all content (posts, pages, media, users) and exposes it via a GraphQL/REST API. This decouples content from presentation.
- **Frontend (Next.js):** A React framework for building the user-facing application. It handles routing, data fetching from Payload CMS, and rendering.
- **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):** The data store for Payload CMS.
- **Media Storage (Local/Cloud):** For storing images and other assets.

## Key Technical Decisions:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js allows for flexible rendering strategies to optimize performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript:** Used throughout the project for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Modular Design:** Components and features are designed to be reusable and independent.
- **API-First Approach:** All content is accessed via APIs, ensuring flexibility and future extensibility.

## Design Patterns in Use:
- **Component-Based Architecture:** React components encapsulate UI elements and their logic.
- **API Layer Abstraction:** A dedicated layer for interacting with the Payload CMS API.
- **State Management:** Local component state and potentially a global state management solution for complex interactions.

## Component Relationships:
- The Next.js frontend consumes data from the Payload CMS API.
- UI components are built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS (or similar).
- Authentication and authorization are handled by Payload CMS and integrated into the Next.js application.
