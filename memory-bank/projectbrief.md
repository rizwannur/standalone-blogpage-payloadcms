# Project Brief: Rafey Blog

## 1. Project Name

Rafey Blog

## 2. Project Goal

To develop a modern, full-stack blog application using Next.js for the frontend and Payload CMS for the backend. The application aims to provide a feature-rich platform for content creation, management, and consumption, with a focus on advanced CMS capabilities and a high-quality user experience.

## 3. Core Requirements

*   **Frontend Development**: Utilize Next.js for a fast, server-rendered React application.
*   **Backend Development**: Implement Payload CMS for robust content management, user authentication, and API generation.
*   **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.
*   **Content Management**: Support for rich blog posts with custom fields, categories, and tags.
*   **Media Management**: Advanced image handling, including optimization and responsive variants.
*   **User Management**: Multi-role authentication system (authors, editors, administrators).
*   **SEO Optimization**: Built-in meta fields, sitemap generation, and social media integration.
*   **Custom Content Types**: Ability to create and manage specialized content like portfolios, testimonials, and project showcases.
*   **API Provision**: Expose content via RESTful and GraphQL APIs for headless capabilities.
*   **Interactive Features**: Implement search functionality, a commenting system, newsletter integration, and analytics.

## 4. Scope

*   **Initial Phase**: Establish the foundational Next.js and Payload CMS setup. Implement core UI components and basic page structures (e.g., homepage, post display, not-found page).
*   **Development Phase**: Iteratively build out the advanced features listed under Core Requirements. This will involve significant modifications to the current project state.
*   **Deployment**: Prepare the application for deployment, potentially using Docker and cloud hosting solutions (as suggested in `README.md`).

## 5. Target Audience

*   **Content Creators/Administrators**: Users who will manage and publish content through Payload CMS.
*   **Readers**: Visitors who will consume the blog content through the Next.js frontend.

## 6. Key Stakeholders

*   The user (Rafey) as the primary developer and product owner.

## 7. Assumptions

*   The project will leverage the existing Next.js and Payload CMS boilerplate as a starting point.
*   Significant development effort will be required to achieve the full feature set.
*   The project will follow modern web development best practices.

## 8. Success Metrics (High-Level)

*   Successful implementation of all core requirements.
*   A stable and performant application.
*   An intuitive and user-friendly interface for both content managers and readers.
*   Positive feedback from the primary stakeholder.
