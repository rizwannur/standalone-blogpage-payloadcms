# Active Context

This document outlines the current focus of development, recent changes, and immediate next steps for the project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Setting up the initial project structure with Next.js and Payload CMS.
- Defining core content types (e.g., Posts, Pages, Media).
- Implementing basic authentication and user management.
- Developing foundational UI components.

## Recent Changes:
- Initialized Next.js project.
- Integrated Payload CMS.
- Configured basic Payload collections (Users, Posts).
- Set up environment variables.

## Next Steps:
1. **Develop Core Collections:** Define and implement all necessary Payload CMS collections (e.g., Categories, Tags, Authors).
2. **Frontend Integration:** Connect Next.js frontend to Payload CMS APIs for data fetching.
3. **Implement UI/UX:** Build out the main pages and components based on the design.
4. **Authentication Flow:** Implement user login/logout and protected routes.
5. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for key functionalities.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Database Choice:** Currently leaning towards MongoDB for simplicity with Payload, but keeping PostgreSQL as an option for future scalability.
- **Styling Approach:** Using Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui for consistent and rapid UI development.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Considering Vercel for Next.js frontend and a separate server/service for Payload CMS.
