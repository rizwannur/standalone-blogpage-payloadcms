# Active Context: Rafey Blog

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on **performing a super detailed update of the entire Memory Bank.** This involves:

*   Sequentially reviewing each Memory Bank file (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `fileRelations.md`).
*   Ensuring each file accurately reflects the current understanding of the project, its goals, and its technical state.
*   Identifying any inconsistencies, outdated information, or areas needing more detail.
*   Updating the files to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible, following the principles of the Memory Bank system.
*   This task itself will be documented within `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.

*   Reviewing and understanding the current project structure and capabilities.
*   Identifying areas for modification and enhancement to meet blog-specific requirements.
*   Implementing core blog features (e.g., post listing, individual post views, category pages, potentially author pages, search).
*   Ensuring a seamless integration between the Payload CMS backend for content management and the Next.js frontend for presentation.
*   Refining the UI/UX for both content administrators and readers.

## 2. Recent Changes & Discoveries

*   **Memory Bank Review**: Completed a full review of all existing Memory Bank files as the first step of the "update memory bank" task.
*   **Previous `not-found.tsx` Page Resolution**: Addressed issues with the custom 404 page.
*   **Initial Memory Bank Creation**: The Memory Bank was previously initiated.

## 3. Next Steps (Sequential Memory Bank Update)

1.  **`projectbrief.md` Update**: Review and enhance for clarity, completeness, and accuracy regarding project goals and scope.
2.  **`productContext.md` Update**: Review and detail the problem, solution, and UX goals with any new insights.
3.  **`systemPatterns.md` Update**: Verify architecture diagrams, technical decisions, and data flow descriptions. Add more detail where necessary, especially regarding component interactions.
4.  **`techContext.md` Update**: Confirm versions of core technologies and libraries. Ensure project structure and setup instructions are current.
5.  **`activeContext.md` Update (Self-reflection)**: Ensure this file accurately reflects the *current* detailed update process itself.
6.  **`progress.md` Update**: Document the progress of this detailed memory bank update. Ensure "What Works" and "What's Left to Build" are accurate from a project-wide perspective, beyond just this update task.
7.  **`fileRelations.md` Update**: Meticulously review and expand on file and function relationships. Add any newly identified interactions or clarify existing ones. This is a critical step for deep understanding.
8.  **`.cursorrules` Review/Update**: Consider if any new patterns or insights have emerged during this detailed review that should be captured in `.cursorrules`.
9.  **Final Review**: Once all individual files are updated, perform a final holistic review of the entire Memory Bank for consistency and completeness.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations (for Memory Bank Update)

*   **Level of Detail**: Strive for maximum useful detail in each file without being overly verbose or redundant. The goal is comprehensive understanding after a memory reset.
*   **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is factually correct based on the current project state and known plans.
*   **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language. Diagrams in `systemPatterns.md` should be easy to understand.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure terminology and descriptions are consistent across all Memory Bank files.
*   **Actionability**: The Memory Bank should provide a clear path forward for future development tasks.
