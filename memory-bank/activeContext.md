# Active Context: Rafey Blog

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on **transforming the existing Payload CMS + Next.js project into a fully functional, modern full-stack blog application.** This involves:

*   Reviewing and understanding the current project structure and capabilities.
*   Identifying areas for modification and enhancement to meet blog-specific requirements.
*   Implementing core blog features (e.g., post listing, individual post views, category pages, potentially author pages, search).
*   Ensuring a seamless integration between the Payload CMS backend for content management and the Next.js frontend for presentation.
*   Refining the UI/UX for both content administrators and readers.

## 2. Recent Changes & Discoveries

*   **`not-found.tsx` Page Resolution**: Addressed issues with the custom 404 page:
    *   Ensured the `'use client'` directive is correctly placed at the very top of the `not-found.tsx` file, as it contains client-side interactivity (e.g., `onClick` handlers, `Link` components from Next.js).
    *   Verified that the page compiles and displays correctly when a non-existent URL is accessed.
    *   This involved deleting a potentially corrupted version of the file and recreating it with the correct structure and client directive.
*   **Memory Bank Creation**: Initiated the creation of this Memory Bank to document the project's state, goals, and technical details to aid in the development process.
*   **Initial Project Assessment**: Gained a foundational understanding of the project's setup, including its use of Payload CMS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various Payload plugins.

## 3. Next Steps (High-Level for Blog Conversion)

1.  **Define Core Blog Functionality & Content Models**: 
    *   Solidify the structure for `Posts` (e.g., ensuring fields for title, slug, author, publication date, featured image, categories, tags, main content).
    *   Review `Categories` and potentially `Tags` collections.
    *   Consider if an `Authors` collection is needed or if user data from the `Users` collection suffices.
2.  **Develop Frontend Blog Pages (Next.js)**:
    *   **Homepage**: Display a list of recent blog posts, potentially with featured content.
    *   **Blog Index Page**: A paginated list of all blog posts.
    *   **Individual Post Page (`[slug].tsx`)**: Display full content of a single blog post.
    *   **Category/Tag Archive Pages**: Display posts filtered by a specific category or tag.
    *   **Author Pages (Optional)**: Display posts by a specific author.
3.  **Implement Data Fetching Logic**: Write functions/logic in Next.js pages/components to fetch data from Payload CMS APIs (e.g., fetching posts, categories).
4.  **Refine UI/UX**: Apply styling using Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly blog interface.
5.  **Integrate Existing Blocks/Components**: Leverage existing Payload blocks (e.g., `ContentBlock`, `MediaBlock`, `CodeBlock`) for rich post content and ensure they render correctly on the frontend.
6.  **SEO Enhancements**: Ensure proper meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation (leveraging `@payloadcms/plugin-seo`).
7.  **Testing**: Test all functionalities across different devices and browsers.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Content Modeling Strategy**: How detailed should the content models be? What custom fields are essential for blog posts beyond standard ones?
*   **Frontend State Management**: For complex interactive features, will simple React context/hooks suffice, or is a more robust state management library needed?
*   **Image Optimization**: How will images be optimized for performance (Payload's built-in capabilities, Next.js Image component)?
*   **Deployment Strategy**: While `README.md` mentions Docker, further consideration for a production deployment environment (e.g., Vercel for Next.js, a managed MongoDB service).
*   **Prioritization**: Which blog features are MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and which can be deferred?

This document will be updated as the project progresses and new decisions are made or context shifts.
